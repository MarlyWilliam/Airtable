# ðŸŸ¦ Airtable Candidate-Shortlisting Automation

Automate your early-stage recruiting workflow right inside **Airtable**:

* Seeds an Airtable base with sample applicants  
* Compresses & decompresses long JSON payloads to fit Airtableâ€™s 100 kB cell limit  
* Runs a rules-based *shortlist* filter (location / company whitelist, etc.)  
* Enriches shortlisted profiles with an **LLM summary, score, and follow-up questions** via DeepSeek  
* Stores everything back in Airtable so hiring managers can triage from a familiar UI
